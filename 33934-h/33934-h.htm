<h1><a name="She_Knew_He_Was_Coming" id="She_Knew_He_Was_Coming"></a>She Knew He Was Coming</h1>

<h3>By Kris Neville</h3>

<h3>Illustrated by Ed Emsh</h3>


<div class='cap'>OUTSIDE, the bluish sun slanted
low across the green dust of the
Martian desert, its last rays sparkling
on the far mountain tops.
One by one, lights flickered on in
the city.</div>

<p>"Mary must be expecting that
Earthman," Anne said. She held
her glastic blouse tight together
over her breasts and leaned a little
out of the window.</p>

<p>Milly nodded. "The <i>Azmuth</i>
landed this morning."</p>

<p>The noises of commerce were
fading. From the window Anne
saw the neon blaze up over the
door. For the thousandth time she
blinked between the equivocal
words: 30&mdash;BEAUTIFUL HOSTESSES&mdash;30.
Laughter, dry and
false, filtered up from the tea bars
along the street. She looked westward,
toward the spaceport, and
made out the shadowy nose of the
berthed space liner looming against
the night. She could picture the
scene&mdash;a thousand stevedores unloading
cargo, refill men and native
spacewriters scurrying over the
sleek hull, the Earth voyageurs
shouting orders and curses.</p>

<p>"Maybe he isn't even on it."
Anne turned from the window. She
crossed to the couch and sat down,
fluffing out the green crinkly glass
of her skirt; pendant, multicolored
birds flashed from the rings in her
ears. She tucked rosy feet under
her scented body. "I don't like
Earthmen," she said.</p>

<p>"They spend money."</p>

<p>"They make me sick," Anne
said. "With their pale skins and
ugly eyes and hairy bodies."</p>

<p>"They have strong arms."</p>

<p>Anne's wide, red mouth curled
in distaste. "They're like a bunch
of kids."</p>

<p>The room was lighted by soft,
overhead fire. Heavy drapes hung
from the walls. Sweet, spicy incense
curled bluely from the burners by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the window.</p>

<p>Before the mirror, Milly edged
in the narrow line of her pink eyebrows
with a pencil. She folded
her lips in, rubbing them together,
licked them, making them a glistening
red. She pinched her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I wonder when they'll catch
Crescent?" she said.</p>

<p>Anne yawned languorously. "It
won't be long."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't want to be in her
shoes," Milly said.</p>

<p>Anne patted her mouth lazily.
"She ought to have known she
couldn't run away."</p>

<p>"What do you think Miss Bestris
will do to her?"</p>

<p>Anne stood up, brushing out the
wrinkles in her dress. "I should
care."</p>

<p>"But what will she do?"</p>

<p>Anne shrugged. "Whip her,
maybe. How should <i>I</i> know?"</p>

<p>"Don't you feel you'd like to run
away, once in a while?" Milly
asked, turning to look at the other
girl.</p>

<p>Anne laughed coldly. "I've got
better sense."</p>

<p>"But don't you <i>want</i> to?"</p>

<p>Anne tossed her purple hair.
"Where is there to go? Who is
there to go to?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... I guess you're right."
Milly turned back to her reflection.</p>

<p><i>Buzzzzzz</i>....</p>

<p>Both girls turned their heads to
the buttons on the wall. The white
one was glowing.</p>

<p>"It's Miss Bestris."</p>

<p>"We'd better go," Milly said.</p>

<p>Together they walked down the
heavily carpeted stairs to the sitting
room.</p>

<p>The Madame was waiting. She
was a large woman, rolling in
creases of fat, and her pink hair
was rough and clipped short. She
had a pair of dimples in her cheeks
and a single gold band around her
right wrist. She was leaning against
the piano.</p>

<p>"Hurry now, girls, hurry right
along," she said.</p>

<p>More girls were entering the
room; they spread out, sitting on
the chairs, curling at the Madame's
feet. Their eyes&mdash;amethyst, gray or
golden&mdash;were on her face. Many
had pink hair, others had tresses of
purple or salmon.</p>

<p>"Now, girls, I suppose you know
there's an Earth ship in port?"</p>

<p>The girls nodded.</p>

<p>"So I expect we'll have visitors
tonight. I want you to all look your
very best." She smiled at them.
"Anne, why don't you wear that
low-cut, orange plastic with the
spangles, and June, you the prim
white one? You look like an angel
in it." June smiled. "And
Mary...?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Bestris?"</p>

<p>"Mary. Did you buy that neo-nylon
I told you about?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Bestris."</p>

<p>"Mary, Mary, Mary. I just don't
understand you at all."</p>

<p>"I'm saving my money, Miss
Bestris," Mary said intently.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I know that. We're
<i>all</i> saving our money. But we simply
must look presentable. We have
a reputation to hold up."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Bestris."</p>

<p>"Then, Mary, dear, do&mdash;do,
<i>please</i>, buy yourself something decent."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Bestris. I will.... Tomorrow.
Tomorrow morning, if
I ..."</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Child? If you what?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Miss Bestris."</p>

<p>"Well. See that you get it tomorrow.
If you don't, I'm afraid I'll
have to take some of your money
and get it for you."</p>

<p>Mary looked down at the floor.
The flaming glow of the hydrojet
torches cast golden lights in her
softly purple hair.</p>

<p>"By the way, Mary. Is that your
cake in the oven?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Bestris."</p>

<p>The other girls snickered.</p>

<p>"Let her alone," said the Madame.
"If she wants to bake a cake,
why shouldn't she?"</p>

<p>No one answered.</p>

<p>Miss Bestris went on around the
room, discussing the girls' clothing,
brushing this girl's hair, pinching
that girl's cheek, chucking this one
under the chin, smiling, frowning.
Then finally she stepped back and
nodded.</p>

<p>"You all look quite good, I
think. I can be proud of you. And
now, I want you all to go to your
rooms and make them extra attractive,
and then try to get a little rest,
so you'll all be especially beautiful
when the boys come. Run along
now."</p>

<p>The girls filed out, and night
continued to settle. After a while,
her cigarette glowing in the gloom,
the Madame waddled to her office.
There three people were waiting
for her.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='cap'>THE OFFICE was plain, businesslike,
masculine; no lace, no
ribbons, no perfume, only the crisp
smell of new paper, the tangy odor
of ink, the sweet smell of eraser
fluid. When she came in the door
the three people stood up.</div>

<p>She waved her cigarette hand
with a once delicate gesture and
flame light glinted dully on the gold
band. "Please don't get up for me,"
she said, but her tone was condescending
and the three visitors sat
down respectfully.</p>

<p>Miss Bestris crossed to her desk;
she perched on a corner of it,
leaned back, blew smoke.</p>

<p>"You wanted to see me about
your girls?"</p>

<p>Two of the people, man and
wife, looked at each other. "Yes,"
they said. And the other man said,
"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you bring any pictures?"</p>

<p>They handed her pictures, and
she held them up to the overhead
torch. She studied them critically,
pursing and unpursing her lips in
secret calculation.</p>

<p>"This one," she said finally,
holding out one of the pictures.</p>

<p>The man and wife rustled their
clothing; they smiled faintly proud
at each other.</p>

<p>The other man got up slowly, retrieved
his picture, left the room
without saying a word.</p>

<p>"We can't do for little Lavada,"
the woman whined. "She was a
late child, and we're getting old,
and we thought she would be better
here. It's hard to do for a growing
girl when you get old. And my
husband can't keep steady work,
because of his health and ..."</p>

<p>"I'm sure she will be happy
here," the Madame said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes," the man agreed. "It's for
the best. But&mdash;you know&mdash;well, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
hate to do it."</p>

<p>"How old is she?"</p>

<p>"... Fourteen."</p>

<p>Miss Bestris studied the picture
again. "She doesn't look over
twelve."</p>

<p>"She's fourteen."</p>

<p>"And healthy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have doctors to see to that,"
the Madame said. "How much did
you have in mind?"</p>

<p>"Well," the man said, "it's been
a month now since I worked, and
with debts and everything...."</p>

<p>"And something to put aside for
winter," his wife added.</p>

<p>"We couldn't take less than a
<i>milli dordoc</i>."</p>

<p>"And we wouldn't even think of
it, but we don't have a scrap of
bread in the house."</p>

<p>"And all our bills, and winter
coming on...."</p>

<p>Miss Bestris turned the picture
this way and that. The parents
waited. The woman cleared her
throat. The man shuffled his feet.
The clock on the wall went tick-tick,
tick-tick.</p>

<p>"I'll give you eight hundred and
thirty <i>dordocs</i>," the Madame said.</p>

<p>"Well...."</p>

<p>Miss Bestris bent forward, holding
out the picture. "Here, then.
Take it. I wouldn't offer that, but
I need a girl right now. One of
mine ran away last week, and I'm
afraid she won't be able to work
for a month or so after they bring
her back. I'm being generous.
Eight hundred and thirty, or take
your picture and don't waste my
time."</p>

<p>The man and woman stared at
her. And the clock went <i>tick-tick</i>.</p>

<p>"Take it, Chav."</p>

<p>"... All right," the man said.
"We need the money."</p>

<p>Miss Bestris leaned across the
desk, pressed a button on her panel.
Almost immediately, a door slid
silently open and her lawyer entered
with a white, printed, standard-form
sales contract in his hand.
Efficiently and rapidly, he entered
the particulars. "Sign here," he
said, and the parents signed.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Madame, "if
you'll bring in Lavada tomorrow
at nine, I'll arrange for a doctor to
be here. If his examination is satisfactory,
the money will be ready."</p>

<p>The lawyer left, and the woman
said, "You understand, we
wouldn't do this but for ..."</p>

<p>"I understand, perfectly," Miss
Bestris said. "You don't need to
worry. This is the best kind of
house&mdash;Earthmen only, you know,
and they're very particular. My
girls are given the best of care. I'm
like a mother to them, and if they
are thrifty and diligent, they'll be
able to save enough money in a&mdash;a
very short time to redeem their
contract as provided by law. You
needn't worry at all."</p>

<p>"Well," the woman said, "I feel
better after talking to you. I feel
better about the whole thing to
hear you talk like that."</p>

<p>The clock went <i>tick-tick</i>.</p>

<p>"Uh," the man said, "you
won't&mdash;? That is, our little daughter
is sometimes wilful and ... uh
... well ... Sometimes."</p>

<p>Miss Bestris smiled. "We know
how to handle girls."</p>

<p>"You'll treat her...?"</p>

<p>"As I would my own child,"
Miss Bestris said; she took out another
cigarette, lit it. "I think we'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
call her&mdash;well&mdash;Poppy. Earthmen
like to feel at home, you know."</p>

<p>The clock went <i>tick-tick</i>.</p>

<p>"Well, uh," the man said. "Uh.
Thank you."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='cap'>IN ONE of the rooms upstairs
Mary sat before the dressing
table with her back to the mirror,
while June and Adele occupied the
two overstuffed chairs. Night
sounds drifted up from the yellow
canal, and fresh flower scents whispered
on the warm air. The diaphanous
glass curtains rustled at
the open window.</div>

<p>"They're too expensive," Mary
said. "I'm sure Miss Bestris overcharges
us for them."</p>

<p>"Hush," said June, glancing
around at the walls nervously.
"Hush, Mary." She smoothed at
the delicate, plutolac lace fringe
above her breasts. "Imported material
like this costs money. You
can't get it for nothing, and we
have to have the best."</p>

<p>"I still think she charges too
much."</p>

<p>Adele shrugged delicately and
crossed shapely ankles. "I think
Miss Bestris must like you, or she
wouldn't let you wear that dress
again tonight. You ought to watch
out that you don't get on the wrong
side of her."</p>

<p>Mary laughed, her amethyst eyes
sparkling. "I won't care. Not after
tonight."</p>

<p>"You're not going to run away?"
June asked breathlessly. "You
wouldn't dare do that. You'd catch
it, sure!"</p>

<p>Mary shook her head. "Not <i>run</i>
away."</p>

<p>Adele leaned forward and said
huskily, "You got enough money
to redeem your contract?"</p>

<p>Again Mary shook her head.
"No. It's nine hundred and ten
<i>dordocs</i>. I have only ninety-three.
But I'll have enough in the morning!"
She stood up and crossed to
the window, looked out toward the
spaceport.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Tell us, Mary!"</p>

<p>"Tell you what?" Anne asked,
coming into the room. Languidly
she drew the door closed behind
her and rested against it. "Tell you
what?" she insisted, narrowing
milky eyes.</p>

<p>"Mary says she can redeem her
contract tomorrow."</p>

<p>Anne's wide mouth curled contemptuously.
"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"It's not," said Mary without
turning.</p>

<p>Anne glided sensuously across
the room to the bed, her tight fitting
plastic rippling with her tigerish
muscles. She sat down.</p>

<p>"He said he'd take me away, this
trip," Mary continued. "He'll sign
off, and then we'll both get a ship
and go to one of the frontier planets.
Where it won't matter about&mdash;all
this."</p>

<p>Anne laughed harshly. "My
God! You believe <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>"We've both been saving our
money," Mary said dreamily. "He's
in love with me. He said so."</p>

<p>"Honey, that's what they all
say."</p>

<p>Smiling, Mary turned from the
window and leaned backward,
stretching. "You don't know him.
He's different."</p>

<p>"They're all the same," Anne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
said, her mouth twisting bitterly.
"They're just alike. Don't believe
any of them."</p>

<p>And Mary said, "With him, it's
different. You'll see."</p>

<p>After a moment, Anne said,
"That Earthman? That what's-his-name?"
Mary nodded, and Anne
brushed an imaginary something
off her knee. "An Earthman,"
Anne said. "They're the worst of
all."</p>

<p>"You don't know him, or you
wouldn't say that."</p>

<p>Adele looked away from Anne.
"You love him, don't you, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You're a fool," Anne said. "Listen
to me. <i>Love</i> a man? God!
You'll see. After him, there'll be
another and another, and&mdash;just
like Rosy&mdash;you'll watch 'em leave
you and laugh at you until finally
you're hurt so bad you don't think
you can stand being hurt any more,
and then along comes another one,
and it starts all over again, and
then one night you take a razor
blade and go to the sink and stick
out your throat and...."</p>

<p>"No! No! You're wrong! He's
not like the rest!"</p>

<p>Anne leaned back carelessly,
resting, propped on one hand.
"See. You know I'm right, already."</p>

<p>"You're not!"</p>

<p>Anne shrugged. "Honey, tell me
that tomorrow night."</p>

<p>"I better go take my cake out,"
Mary said. She fled the room in a
swirl of shimmering glastic.</p>

<p>Anne sneered, "I don't see why
Miss Bestris puts up with her the
way she does."</p>

<p>"You're jealous," June said
quietly.</p>

<p>Anne did not answer.</p>

<p>"Mary's decent," Adele said.
"Maybe that's why. She's from the
sticks, and her parents still come
to see her on visiting days, and
there's something about her so&mdash;so
innocent. Maybe that's why Miss
Bestris likes her."</p>

<p>June said, "I think she's better
than the rest of us. I think Miss
Bestris feels sorry for her in a way."</p>

<p>"Don't make me laugh," Anne
said, facing June. "The only one
that'll ever feel sorry for her is herself!"</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have talked like
that to her!" June snapped. "Why
don't you let her alone? She'll feel
bad enough without you helping!"</p>

<p>Anne rolled over on the bed and
stared up at the ceiling. June took
a helox lamp from her drawer and
started to bake her hair darker.
Those Earthmen were so funny
about colors.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, Mary took the
cake out of the oven. It was steamy
and light and fluffy, and it smelled
sweet and warm. She set it on the
table and mixed a two-minute
green frosting which she spread,
carefully, over the cake. She patted
here and there with the spatula
and stood back, her eyes proud and
serious.</p>

<p>She hummed a little tune under
her breath as she scrubbed the pots
and pans. Her hands moved in
practiced rhythm, and the water
splashed and gurgled. When the
kitchen was again spotless, she
looked once more at the cake, and
then, turning out the light, she
went back to her room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Anne and Adele had left, but
June was sitting quietly in the
dusky moonlight. Her white dress
seemed vaguely luminous.</p>

<p>Laughing, Mary flicked on the
light.</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful cake," she
said. "The best one I ever made.
Just the way it should be."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't feel too bad, Mary,
if he doesn't come to eat it," June
said. "I don't want to sound like
Anne, but there was a lot of sense
in what she said."</p>

<p>"It's just like a real wedding
cake." She hummed the snatch of
Martian tune. "Like in the tele-papers."
She laughed with her eyes.
"The bridegroom takes the silver
knife and cuts two large pieces of
the cake while the bride, dressed in
filament coral, stands at his right
hand. She carries a bouquet of&mdash;Anne
just likes to be mean!"</p>

<p>June frowned. Mary crossed to
the dressing table. She studied her
face in the mirror. It was heart
shaped, elfin; her purple hair was
a riot of curls, and her eyes were
amethyst and gold. She smiled at
herself. "I want to look as pretty as
I can tonight." She twisted around.
"You don't think he'll come either,
do you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;no, Mary."</p>

<p>Mary looked back at the mirror.
"He likes our canal blossom perfume."
She dabbed some of it on
her ear lobes. "I like it best, too."</p>

<p>June stood up, crossed to the
musikon, found a slow five-toned
waltz. She turned the music very
low, and left the color mixer dim
enough so that only the faintest
ghosts projected hues moved on
walls and ceiling.</p>

<p>Mary continued to stare into the
mirror. "But he will come. I know
it."</p>

<p>June said nothing.</p>

<p>"Don't you see. I just <i>know</i> he'll
come."</p>

<p>June crossed back to her seat.</p>

<p>Mary turned from the mirror.
"I'm sure he will. He's&mdash;I
mean...."</p>

<p>June smiled wanly.</p>

<p>"Well, he will! You'll see!"</p>

<p>June said, "Even if it is an old
dress, you look very nice in it."</p>

<p>"I've been learning his language.
I can say 'thank you' and 'yes' and
'no' and 'I love you' and all kinds
of things in it. He gave me a book,
and I've been studying. I want to
be able really to talk with him.
We've got a lot to talk about. I
want to find out about his parents,
and what he likes for supper and
what kind of music he likes to hear,
and&mdash;and all sorts of things. I want
to find out all about his planet,
and...."</p>

<p>"Yes," June said wearily, "I
know."</p>

<p>The music played on. The moving
lights on the walls were like
colored reflections from a sunlit
river.</p>

<p>"He may be a little late tonight;
he has a lot to do, first. But he'll be
here."</p>

<p><i>Buzzzzz</i>....</p>

<p>It was the red button; it blinked
on and off.</p>

<p>"Visitors," June said.</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;" Mary said. "Look,
June. I'm not half ready yet. Look.
Tell Miss Bestris I'll be down a little
late. Tell her I have a special
boy, and it'll be all right. He wants
me to wait for him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>June was on her feet. "... All
right. You'd better not wait too
long!"</p>

<p>"I won't."</p>

<p>After June was gone, Mary returned
to the task of making her
face pretty, but after a moment,
she turned from the mirror, leaned
back, and tried to relax. Underneath
her dress, her heart was
pounding.</p>

<p>The warm air carried sounds of
the night creatures. One of the
great canal insects, screeching,
flapped by the window. The tiny
third moon crept up over the horizon,
and the buildings cast triple
shadows.</p>

<p><i>Buzzz. Buzzzz.</i></p>

<p>Still Mary waited.</p>

<p><i>Buzzz. Buzzzz. Buzzzzzz....</i></p>

<p>She was afraid to wait any
longer. But by now she was sure
that he would be down stairs.</p>

<p>There was a last-minute flurry of
combing and primping, and then
she rustled out of the room, her
head erect, her eyes shining.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='cap'>THE LARGE reception room was
filling. Overhead, the color organ
threw shimmering, prismatic
beams on the ceiling. Beneath it,
stiff, embarrassed spacemen, mostly
officers dressed in parade uniforms,
chatted in space-pidgin with the
laughing, rainbow-haired girls.</div>

<p>Miss Bestris sat in one corner,
her eyes roving the room: settling
here for a second, there for a second,
checking, approving, disapproving,
silently. Occasionally she
would smile or nod at one of the
girls or one of the spacemen, and
once she frowned ever so slightly
and shook her head.</p>

<p>Anne was reclining on a couch,
eating a golden Martian apple, listening
to a second mate; she
played with a lock of his hair and
smiled her wide smile.</p>

<p>June, angelic, sat primly in a
straight-backed chair, the captain
at her feet, a boyish, space-pale
Earthman, drew embarrassed circles
on the carpet with his index
finger.</p>

<p>In the next room, three couples
were dancing to the slow music of
an Earth orchestra.</p>

<p>An inner door opened, and a
uniformed native sheriff stepped in,
a crisp, military figure. "Miss Bestris?"</p>

<p>She stood up. "Yes?"</p>

<p>The Earthmen fell silent, waiting.</p>

<p>"We think we have your runaway."
He turned to the door.
"Bring her in."</p>

<p>Two more sheriffs entered, and
between them, there was a young,
slender girl. Her face was gaunt
and tear-stained. Her body trembled.
She looked at the Madame
fearfully.</p>

<p>"You idiots!" Miss Bestris
screamed. "Get her out of here!
You'll ruin my party! Take her
out!"</p>

<p>The two men removed the girl.
To the remaining sheriff, Miss Bestris
said, "Damn you, if you ever do
anything like that again, I'll ...
I'll...."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Madame. But we
wanted immediate identification.
Would you want us to hold the
wrong girl?"</p>

<p>"That's her, all right! Now, get
out! Wait for me in my office."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>When they were gone Miss Bestris
turned to the silent room. In
quite passable Esperanto she said,
"I&mdash;am sorry. A misunderstanding.
I assure you, nothing. Go on with
the party, and I'll see what I can
do for the poor girl."</p>

<p>She stood up and in her own
language said, "Lively, girls!
Smile! You, Rita, hurry and serve
tea!"</p>

<p>She made her exit.</p>

<p>The spacemen grumbled among
themselves, coughed uneasily,
watched the closed door through
which the Madame had gone. Listening,
they could hear only a
muted mumble of sing-song sounds
in several voices.</p>

<p>With determined animation, the
girls moved about, smiled, chatted.</p>

<p>Rita came in, wheeling the tea
tray, and the girls converged on it,
each trying to be the first to serve
her escort. The tea was the Martian
stuff, concocted of a kind of
local hemp. The Earthmen found
it harsh and bitter to the taste, but
gentle on the soul.</p>

<p>Anne had filled two cups and returned
to the second mate when
she caught sight of Mary coming
down the stairs.</p>

<p>On the lowest step, Mary stood
for a long time; her eyes eagerly
searched the crowd. Slowly a puzzled,
hurt look came over her face.</p>

<p>June came to her side after a little
while.</p>

<p>"Isn't he here?"</p>

<p>"No. Not yet."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," June said, touching
Mary's arm lightly.</p>

<p>"It's all right. It's early yet. I'll
just sit down by Miss Bestris' chair
and wait for him."</p>

<p>She turned from June and went
to the chair. Before she could sit
down, a space corporal came over,
bowed, tried to take her hand. She
shook her head. He smiled twistedly
and walked stiffly away.</p>

<p>Another man smiled at her. She
shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>Someone came in the front door,
and she leaned forward. Then she
slumped back limply.</p>

<p>She heard a tinkly laugh. She
looked in its direction. She met
Anne's eyes, bright and amused.
Just then Miss Bestris came in, her
eyes angry and her cheeks flushed.
She strode across the room.</p>

<p>"Well," she said. "I'm glad to
see you finally came down." She
sank heavily into her chair. "Cresent's
back. They just brought her
in. The idiots came right in here
with her. I'll bet I lost half-a-dozen
customers. These Earthmen are
sensitive about such things."</p>

<p>Mary was still staring at the
door; Miss Bestris looked down at
her.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you sitting here
for?"</p>

<p>"Please, Miss Bestris. I'm waiting
for my special boy friend tonight."</p>

<p>She snorted and looked away.
"Why isn't he here?"</p>

<p>"He will be."</p>

<p>"He'd better. I'll let you wait another&mdash;half
an hour. That's all."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Bestris. You're
very kind to me."</p>

<p>"I indulge you more than I
ought to, child," she said. "More
than is good for you, if the truth
were known."</p>

<p>A man came in; Mary stiffened
and then relaxed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The mutter of voices blended
into a steady hum. More couples
were dancing. Miss Bestris moved
around the room. The music was
tinny.</p>

<p>Another man came in.</p>

<p>"Your time's up," the Madame
told Mary.</p>

<p>"Please, let me just wait for another
few minutes."</p>

<p>Miss Bestris fixed her lips grimly.
"I've had enough nonsense for
tonight. You heard me!"</p>

<p>"<i>Please!</i>"</p>

<p>"You heard what I said."</p>

<p>"Miss Bestris, I couldn't. Not tonight.
Honest, I couldn't. If I had
to talk to anybody, I'd break down
and cry. He'll ... come. I know he
will."</p>

<p>Miss Bestris whirled on her.
"Listen, you little&mdash;" But she
stopped, suddenly. "All right," she
said, gritting her teeth. "I can't
afford another scene tonight. But
you'll be sorry for this."</p>

<p>Miss Bestris stormily looked
away. The dancers danced; the
music swelled louder. Gradually,
deliberately, the lights were waning.</p>

<p>"Haven't I always been good to
you, Mary?" the Madame asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then like an obedient girl, do
as I say. If he hasn't come by now,
he just won't. He's gone to some
other house."</p>

<p>"No!" Mary said doggedly.</p>

<p>"Just remember, tomorrow, how
you deliberately disobeyed me.
Your silly emotions are costing me
money, and that's one thing I simply
won't stand for."</p>

<p>"He'll come." Mary said. "You
won't lose money."</p>

<p>Couples sat side by side, laughing,
talking in whispers. Occasionally
there were giggles. The room
began to empty slowly.</p>

<p>The lights continued to dim until
the rooms were gloomy. Even
the shifting shades of the color organ
were no more than a faint
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'lambence'">ambience</ins>. Anne, laughing, helped
her second mate to his feet.</p>

<p>"I'll give you one more chance,"
Miss Bestris said. "The next man
that comes in...."</p>

<p>"No! I just couldn't! Not tonight!"</p>

<p>A few more customers drifted in.
Then even the stragglers stopped
coming. It was very late.</p>

<p>"He's deserted you; you see that
now?" Madame Bestris sneered.</p>

<p>Mary stood up. There were tears
in her eyes. "You can't&mdash;you don't&mdash;know&mdash;how
I feel," she choked.
"You don't care!" She turned and
ran up the stairs, crying.</p>

<p>Several Earthmen, still in the big
room, turned to watch. The torches
were misty twinkles now. The last
couples climbed the stairs and then
Miss Bestris, too, went to bed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class='cap'>THE BLUE morning came. The
town awoke; commerce began.</div>

<p>At seven, Miss Bestris lay in bed
frowning, considering the events of
the previous evening. But she was
not so annoyed that she forgot to
call a doctor on the teleview and
arrange for him to come at nine to
give a physical examination.</p>

<p>Her bulk out of bed, she dressed
and went to the kitchen to brew a
pot of hemp tea. The cleaning
maid, moving about in the next
room, heard Miss Bestris call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
sharply: "Flavia! Come in here!"</p>

<p>Flavia appeared with a dust rag
in her hand.</p>

<p>"Did you cut this cake?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

<p>Miss Bestris glowered. "That little
idiot! She must have slipped
down here after we were all asleep
and sat here and cried her silly little
eyes out! If she thinks she can
pull that love-sick act on me she'll
soon find out different. Am I supposed
to put up with having her
moon over every space tramp that
comes in? Why, I've taken more
from her&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>Miss Bestris waddled to the
stairs, climbed them determinedly.
At Mary's door she stopped and
twisted the knob. Locked!</p>

<p>Miss Bestris hammered. "Open
up, Mary!" The door rattled under
her hand. "Open that door at
once!"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>Miss Bestris pounded harder.
"Open up, I say!"</p>

<p>Anne sauntered into the hall, her
dressing gown swishing. "She really
made you look the fool last night,
didn't she?" Anne said lazily.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you slut! Mind your own
business."</p>

<p>Anne smiled and shrugged.</p>

<p>"Open the door, Mary! Do you
hear me! Open it!"</p>

<p>"Maybe she killed herself," Anne
said. "It has happened."</p>

<p>"My God! No.... She wouldn't
dare. You think she would?"</p>

<p>Anne shrugged again. "They do
funny things sometimes."</p>

<p>Miss Bestris' face was red. "Run
down and get my keys. In my desk.
You know where they are."</p>

<p>Then, "<i>For God's sake, hurry!</i>"</p>

<p>While she waited Miss Bestris
rattled the door, pleading and cursing.</p>

<p>Finally Anne returned. Miss Bestris
snatched the key with a shaking
hand. She hurled the door
open and burst inside.</p>

<p>"See here, you little&mdash;!" She
stopped.</p>

<p>The room was empty.</p>

<p>On the neatly made bed reposed
a little stack of money. When Miss
Bestris got around to counting it,
she found that it contained exactly
nine hundred and ten <i>dordocs</i>.</p>
